Fork of https://github.com/esig/dss-demonstrations with built-in support for custom trusted root certificates for the web-app.

Put all *.pem*s into *./custom-trusted-certificates/* and run *./build-with-custom-keystore.sh* to build the standalone web-app archive *./dss-demo-bundle/target/dss-demo-bundle-5.11.zip*.
